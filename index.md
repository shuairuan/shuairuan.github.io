## Welcome to official site of shuairuan corporation!
__To be clear, we are a studio, just make softwares and play games!__

All files are saved to [Site repository](https://github.com/shuairuan/shuairuan.github.io), but you need to clone them entirely and checkout branch.
Probably couple of gigabyte. If you have a slow internet connection. Please send an [email](mailto:frank_ruan@outlook.com) to owner of studio, and get the file. Otherwize, you probably need to download forever to get the one hundreds or kilobytes file....

We will keep update!

Best wishes,
Frank Ruan.
Business operation.
